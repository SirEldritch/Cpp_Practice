vector<T>v1
    // Vector that holds objects of type T. Default initialization
    // v1 is empty
vector<T>v2(v1)
    // v2 has a copy of v1 elements
vector<T>v2 = v1
    // v2 has a copy of v1 elements
vector<T>v3(n,val)
    // v3 has n elements of value val
vector<T>v4(n)
    // v4 has n copies of a value-initialized object.
vector<T>v5{a,b,c...}
    // v5 has as many elements as there are initializers; elements
    // are initialized by corresponding initializers
vector<T>v1 = {a,b,c...}
    // Equivalent to v5
