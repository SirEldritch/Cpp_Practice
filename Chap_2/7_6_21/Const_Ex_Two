//int i = -1, &r = 0;
// i is fine, &r must be const first to initialize and then ref
//int *const p2 = &i2;
// legal, pointer p2 will always point towards i2
//const int i = -1, &r = 0;
// Uber legal, I don't see any issues regarding this
//const int *const p3 = &i2;
// legal
//const int *p1 = &i2;
// legal, no issues with line
//const int &const r2;
// illegal, r2 has reference an integer and it's acting like
// a pointer than a ref.
//const int i2 = i, &r = i;
// legal, assuming i was defined
